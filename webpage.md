## Making the Pinhole Camera Box

I started with the shipping box for my girlfriends' running shoes. I opened the box up with some scissors and lined one inside wall with white printer paper. The other walls I lined with black fabric I cut from some old frisbee shorts. The black fabric was meant to reduce any reflections from the inside walls of the box.

I also cut a hole into the fabric on the opposite wall as the printer paper. This hole is where the pinhole and camera hole will be located.

Then I closed the box up again with some packaging tape. I used ducktape to cover up the endges that may let in light. I also cut a hole into the cardboard for the camera on my phone (iPhone 11).

I then cut an almost 1 inch square above the camera hole. This is where I put my various pinholes.

Finally, I covered the 1 inch square hole with aluminum foil and made my pinholes in the foil. The aluminum foil made it really easy to size and redo the holes as I could just rip off the old foil and replace it with new foil if I ever needed to redo my pinholes.

I later punched 2 more holes into the aluminum foil and used small strips of ductape to cover 2 out of the 3 holes at a time while I was taking pictures.

Here is how the final product looked with my phone attached to it. You can see the image of the kitchen light in the camera screen!

## The Photos

To test the 3 different pinhole sizes, I took photographs of the view from my house window and an apartment building wall. I used a 4 second exposure which was a good balance between getting enough light and not getting too much motion blur as my box would quiver in the wind.

I actually had to go out 2 separate days for photos as I learned that in order to get good photos, I needed to have really well lit subjects. The first time I went, it was overcast so the photos did not come out so well.

Below are my photos testing the 3 different pinhole sizes. Note that I didn't have a ruler so I couldn't measure the pinhole sizes accurately, but I did use a 0.5mm mechanical pencil to create the holes so I estimated the measurements of the pinhole based on the pencil lead size.

After testing the different hole sizes. I decided that I liked how the photos taken with the medium sized pinhole (~1.5mm) came out the most. The smallest hole sometimes got some very sharp photos, but it was really hard to get a bright photo. I don't actually know why in the photo from the window the smallest hole was able to get such a bright image, but I wasn't able to recreate this with other subjects.

Below are some more photos I took with this pinhole size.
